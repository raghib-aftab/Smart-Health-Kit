Smart Health Kit v2
===================

This archive contains offline demo:

1) pdf-demo/
   - Same UI and flow, but the final step generates a downloadable PDF using jsPDF.
   - Files: index.html, styles.css, script.js
   - The PDF collects entered data, selected chips, symptoms, and notes.

How to use:
- Unzip the folder, open either demo's index.html in a browser.
- For PDF demo, allow the browser to load the jsPDF CDN (internet required to fetch jsPDF).
- Both demos are offline-first except for the jsPDF CDN in the pdf-demo (you may replace with local jsPDF if desired).

Notes:
- Fonts/icons are system defaults. Replace with your preferred webfont if needed.
- The styling aims to match the dark theme, rounded cards, and blue accent from your screenshots.
